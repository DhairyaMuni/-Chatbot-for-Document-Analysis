# Chatbot for Document Analysis

## Description
This project involves the development of a chatbot designed to extract and provide information from large Excel or PDF documents in response to user queries. The system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the content of the documents and answer questions accurately. 

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the chatbot and document processing.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For understanding and processing user queries.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: To enhance the chatbot's ability to understand context and provide accurate responses.
- **Machine Learning**: For improving the chatbotâ€™s performance over time based on user interactions.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and processing of Excel files.
  - `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` for extracting text from PDF documents.
  - `LangChain` for managing interactions with LLMs.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot_document_analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd chatbot_document_analysis
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the chatbot:
    ```bash
    streamlit run Main.py
    ```

## Performance Evaluation
The chatbot's performance can be evaluated based on:

- **Accuracy**: The correctness of the responses provided to user queries.
- **Response Time**: The time taken to process queries and return answers.
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from users regarding the chatbot's effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of NLP and LLMs in developing a chatbot capable of analyzing and extracting information from large documents. The integration of machine learning allows the system to improve its responses over time, making it a valuable tool for users seeking quick and accurate information from extensive datasets.
